# GraphicsFromScratch

This project is aimed to get a greater understaning of a "few" things:
 - Common data strucutres such as dynamic arrays, lists, hash maps, trees etc...
 - Platform specific windowing APIs such as WIN32 and Wayland (idk if X11 is worth it)
 - Efficient logging in a big project
 - Learning the Vulkan API to implement an efficient renderer
 - Creating a performant math library
