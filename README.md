# GraphicsFromScratch

GraphicsFromScratch (GFS) is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of various fundamental concepts in graphics programming and low-level system development.<br>
The primary goal is to build everything from scratch while learning key topics along the way.<br>
<br><br>
Through this project, I aim to explore and implement:
 - __Common data strucutres__ - Implementing dynamic arrays, lists, hash maps, trees, and other essential structures.
 - __Platform-Specific Windowing APIs__ – Understanding and working with Win32 and Wayland (still considering X11) while still provifing GLFW and SDL3 implementations.
 - __Efficient Logging__ – Designing a robust logging system suitable for large-scale projects.
 - __Vulkan API__ – Learning Vulkan from the ground up to build an efficient renderer.
 - __Math Library__ – Creating a high-performance math library tailored for graphics applications.


This project is purely for educational purposes and serves as a hands-on way to learn about these technologies by implementing them directly.
